# E-MERCHIFY

## Description
E-Merchify is the back end for an e-commerce application that allows users to configure an already working Express.js API and interact with a MySQL database using Sequelize. Accessing related endpoints, users can implement CRUD methods on their database. 

## Installation
- `git clone` this repository to use locally 
- run `npm init` to install all the necessary packages including `dotenv`
- create a `.env` file that includes the database name as well as your MySQL username and password

## Usage
- make sure to run `npm run seed` to get started
- run `npm start` to start the server
- use Insomnia to test out endpoints for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
